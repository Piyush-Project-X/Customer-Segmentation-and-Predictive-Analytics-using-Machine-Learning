This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and enhance business decision-making. By implementing K-Means clustering for segmentation, we identified distinct customer groups based on purchasing patterns, frequency, and recency of transactions. The project also includes supervised learning techniques, such as logistic regression, to predict customer segments, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

Key Features:
Customer Segmentation: Used K-Means clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments based on purchasing frequency, monetary value, and days since last purchase.

Predictive Modeling: Implemented supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression) to classify customers into pre-identified segments.

Dimensionality Reduction: Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize clustering results in 2D and 3D.

Model Evaluation: Validated clustering with Davies-Bouldin Index and evaluated classification performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better interpretability of results.
